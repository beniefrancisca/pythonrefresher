I graduated from Solent university in MSc applied artificial intelligence and data science 
and its been sometime since i last used my skills so i thought to revist some courses i had signed
up to on udemy to refresh my memory on old technqiues and brush up on some skills.

This will include all the tasks and examples used in the online course and same with the python fundamentals
repositry.
